    <h2 class="heading">Project Description</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my Recipe Project for The Odin Project, by Duval Le Blanc</p>
    <p> This is the HTML Project for the Foundations Portion of The Odin Project.</p>
    <p> The site is utilizing href for images, it has multiple pages to manuever to using href.
        The instruction of the project were simply to create the index, 2 recipe pages with instruction on 
        how it should look. I really enjoyed the project. I decided to go over and beyond to add some more
        flavor and design to the site to make it look more appealing and also for me to have the oppurtunity 
        fully see how some of these elements can work together. Since the next section is CSS I left the site 
        as the default color and did not include anything that I would learn in the next section. 
    </p>
